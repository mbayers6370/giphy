GIPHY (Painted Giphy)

The intent of this page is to:

*Create buttons dynamically, with user input

*Once created or pushed the button will generate 10 images using the value of the button as a search query on Giphy.

*The individual images are dynamic in that they store both still and gif images. Press once and they play, press again and they stop.
