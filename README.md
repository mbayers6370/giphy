GIPHY (Painted Giphy)

The intent of this project is to add buttons dynamically that which when pressed will generate 10 giphy images. These images must play when pressed, and stop playing when pressed again.

This is solved through use of a straightforward responsive interface - easy to navigate and understand from a user standpoint.
There are three generated buttons appended to the window, upon click they reveal 10 images from the Giphy API. The user may also input
any given artist and a button will appear with their input. This button may also be clicked to reveal 10 gifs, which will animate and stop animating upon click.

Process:

Generate buttons that will use user input to push into the value.

This value will be used to call to the Giphy API and return ten images.

Used JavaScript to animate and stop animating these images upon click through these values.
